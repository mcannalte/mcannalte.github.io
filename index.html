                <h2 class = "subtitle">Student</h2>
                I am currently pursuing a BS in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My
                course work is split ~equally between topics in software engineering and data science.
                <br/><br/><hr/><br/>
                There, I've been an inaugural <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/engineering-city-scholars/">
                Engineering City Scholar</a> and a fellow of the 3rd cohort of
                the <a href="http://iventure.illinois.edu/">iVenture Accelerator</a>. My time outside of the classroom
                is mostly directed toward entrepreneurship, research, and side projects.
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class = "subtitle">Entrepreneur</h2>
                I got my start as an entrepreneur by co-founding a crowdfunding startup called Bilder engineered for
                non-profits and local governments. The platform I helped build is no longer around, although it has been
                a compelling foray into further pursuits.
                <br/><br/><hr/><br/>
                My interests today lie in electronic voting, brain-computer interfaces, and scalable methods of
                crowdsourcing.
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class = "subtitle">Professional</h2>
                As a professional, I have best excelled in a rapid-prototyping environment. Given a set of constraints,
                I enjoy developing creative solutions with the foresight to scale in production.
                <br/><br/><hr/><br/>
                I have worked as both a data scientist and a software engineer, with preference only given to the role
                whose problems require the most compelling solutions.
